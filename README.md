Open Source AUV Electrical Subsystem, developed by Robert Fudge 2024-2025

## Introduction
This project was undertaken to support my Universities Capstone Team, with the aim of producing a cost-effective small Autonomous Underwater Vehicle. The project is composed of a colaborative effort to design an open-source dataset and model for detection of hazardous physcial landforms. The above design is supported by an open-source interior chassis and an associated electrical subsystem.

The contained electrcial design schematics, videos, and physical assembly were completed by Robert Fudge as cotnribution to this project.

## Use
